    "#   Class Method in Python--\n",
    "#   Class methods are associated with the class rather than instances. They are defined using the\n",
    "#   @classmethod decorator and take the class itself as the first parameter, usually named cls. Class methods\n",
    "#   are useful for tasks that involve the class rather than the instance, such as creating class-specific behaviors\n",
    "#   or modifying class-level attributes.\n",

    "# Instance methods are the most common type of methods in Python classes. They are associated with instances of a \n",
